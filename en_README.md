## Projects

1. ⚛️ **[Learning React](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/learning-react):**
   - Tech Stack: JavaScript and TailwindCSS.
   - My first encounter with React resulted in a blog web app. Discover how I learned to love React components as much as I appreciate well-implemented algorithms.
  
2. 🚀 **[Learning NodeJs](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/learning-nodejs):**
   - Tech Stack: JavaScript, MongoDB, and Express.
   - I explored the NodeJs universe by creating a CRUD user API. Welcome to 'NodeVerse,' where even the database is an active part of the narrative. Get ready to CRUDtify this experience!
  
3. 🖖 **[Learning VueJs](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/learning-vuejs):**
   - Tech Stack: VUE3 and TailwindCSS.
   - I delved into VueJs with a web app for managing shopping lists. Discover how VueJs makes friendly interfaces easy, while I try to keep my shopping list under control. Spoiler: Buying chocolate has never been more efficient!

4. 🔍 **[Human Sciences Quiz Web App](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/schoolwork-quiz-webapp):**
   - Tech Stack: PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
   - I developed this web app for an online humanities quiz. The landing page is a fun introduction to the chaotic world of humanities. Create your account, start the quiz, and discover that History is as unpredictable as the result!

5. 🎮 **[Math Game](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/schoolwork-mathgame):**
   - Tech Stack: VB.net.
   - Enter the mathematical arena! Create a user, face the 1 times table in phase 1, and climb to phase 10. Prove that you are the multiplication master, and the only thing dividing by zero here is your enthusiasm!
  
6. 📘 **[Minecraft Wiki](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/schoolwork-bmi-calculator):**
   - Tech Stack: VB.net.
   - I created a Wiki for all Minecraft versions (1.17 at the time). Walk through the information cave and discover that, just like in the game, the Wiki has a dark theme. Note: No creepers, only explosive knowledge!

7. 📏 **[BMI Calculator](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/schoolwork-bmi-calculator):**
   - Tech Stack: VB.net.
   - BMI calculator to measure how 'geek' I am in shape. Find out if you're more 'Bit' or 'Byte' and if your body is more binary code than human. Spoiler: Never trust an algorithm to tell you if you're in shape!
  
8. 💻 **[VB.net list of programs](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/schoolwork-vbnet-programs):**
   - Tech Stack: VB.net.
   - A list of 16 VB.net programs ranging from 'Hello, World!' to 'Dominating the Universe with VB.net.' Each program is an epic journey into the wonderful (and sometimes frustrating) world of VB.net. Spoiler: 'Hello, World!' is just the prologue!
  
## How to Navigate Through Projects

To explore more details about each project, visit the links above. Each project has a more detailed description and information about the technology used.

## Skills Acquired

While working on these projects, I acquired the following skills:

- 🧠 Developed my programming logic by building programs in VB.net. Now, my code is so logical that even algorithms seek advice from me.

- 🌐 Structured HTML documents semantically. My pages are now like poems; each tag is a stanza, and each element is a word that tells a story.

- 📱 Learned to make responsive and mobile-first layouts using Flexbox in CSS. Now, my designs are more flexible than a yoga session for developers.

- 🚀 Learned a good part of the JavaScript world, even mastering some frameworks like Vue. Now, programming in JavaScript is like a dance, and I am the master of the code dance floor.

- 🌐 Learned to create my own API using NodeJs and interact with a database. Now, databases and I are like best friends, always sharing secrets (and data).

- ...and others. After all, each line of code is a step toward the infinite universe of development!

## Learning Resources

Study sources I recommend:

- 🥷 [NetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja): YouTube channel with direct-to-the-point lessons, bringing projects and technologies in an engaging way. It's like a series marathon, but with code.

- 🔥 [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@fireship): Channel with humorous videos about tutorials, curiosities, and technology news. Learning here is like eating pizza: it's fun, and you always want more.

- 🐧 [Diolinux](https://www.youtube.com/@Diolinux): The largest Brazilian channel for lessons, tutorials, and news on the open-source side of technology. Some videos have titles and subtitles in English, to please even Uncle Sam.

- 🏋️‍♂️ [Exercism](https://exercism.org/): A nonprofit platform that delivers fluency in over 67 programming languages through exercises. If you like it, make a donation! It's the only place where sweating while programming is highly recommended.

- 📚 [Educative](https://www.educative.io/): An interactive learning platform with certifications in programming languages and general technologies. Most courses are paid, but, as they say, knowledge is priceless (but sometimes comes with a subscription).

I'll be updating this list as I find more quality study sources.
