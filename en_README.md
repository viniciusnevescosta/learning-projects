## Projects

1. ⚛️ **[Learning React](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/learning-react):**
   - Tech Stack: JavaScript and TailwindCSS.
   - My first encounter with React resulted in a blog web app. Discover how I learned to love React components as much as I appreciate the beauty of a well-implemented algorithm.

2. 🚀 **[Learning NodeJs](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/learning-nodejs):**
   - Tech Stack: JavaScript, MongoDB, and Express.
   - Explored the NodeJs universe by creating a CRUD user API. Welcome to 'NodeVerse,' where even the database is an active part of the narrative. Get ready to CRUDtify this experience!

3. 🖖 **[Learning VueJs](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/learning-vuejs):**
   - Tech Stack: VueJs and TailwindCSS.
   - Dived into VueJs with a shopping list management web app. Discovered how VueJs makes creating user-friendly interfaces easy while trying to keep my shopping list in check. Spoiler: Buying chocolate has never been more efficient!

4. 📦 **[inventory-management-app](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/inventory-management-app):**
   - Tech Stack: Mongoose, Express, DenoJs.
   - A Restful API for an inventory management system.

5. 💼 **[Dev Community](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/dev-community):**
   - Tech Stack: TypeScript and SCSS.
   - Project portfolio. View all public projects of a profile using the Github API. Because showcasing one project at a time is so last season.

6. ✍️ **[Simple Blog](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/simple-blog):**
    - Tech Stack: JavaScript and SCSS.
    - Supposed to be a blog web app. Serves more as a diary of small ideas with blog-like features. Sometimes, projects are like cats; they have a mind of their own.

7. 🎮 **[Xbox Series X](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/xbox-series-x):**
    - Tech Stack: VueJs.
    - Landing page with the theme of the new Microsoft console, the Xbox Series X. Because even a page can be next-gen.

8. 🔐 **[Login Page](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/login-page):**
    - Tech Stack: SCSS.
    - Simple login page, just that, but it's also beautiful. Sometimes, less is more (but style is essential).

9. 👟 **[Tennis Page](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/tennis-page):**
    - Tech Stack: SCSS.
    - Presentation page of some sneakers that made history in the '90s but are still cool today. Because classics never go out of style.

10. 🔍 **[Human Sciences Quiz](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/human-sciences-quiz):**
      - Tech Stack: PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
      - Developed this web app for an online human sciences quiz. The landing page is a fun introduction to the chaotic world of humanities. Create your account, start the quiz, and discover that history is as unpredictable as the result!

11. 🎮 **[Math Game](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/math-game):**
      - Tech Stack: VB.net.
      - Enter the math arena! Create a user, face the multiplication table of 1 in phase 1, and climb to phase 10. Prove that you are the master of multiplication, and the only thing dividing by zero here is your enthusiasm!
  
12. 📘 **[Minecraft Wiki](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/schoolwork-wiki-minecraft):**
      - Tech Stack: VB.net.
      - Created a Wiki for all Minecraft versions (1.17 at the time). Stroll through the information cave and discover that, just like in the game, the Wiki also has a dark theme. Note: No creepers here, just explosive knowledge!

13. 📏 **[BMI Calculator](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/bmi-calculator):**
      - Tech Stack: VB.net.
      - BMI calculator to measure how 'geek' I am in shape. Find out if you lean more towards 'Bit' or 'Byte' and if your body is more binary code than human. Spoiler: Never trust an algorithm to tell you if you're in shape!
  
14. 💻 **[Vbnet Exercises](https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/vbnet-exercises):**
      - Tech Stack: VB.net.
      - A list of 16 VB.net programs ranging from 'Hello, World!' to 'Dominating the Universe with VB.net.' Each program is an epic journey into the wonderful (and sometimes frustrating) world of VB.net. Spoiler: 'Hello, World!' is just the prologue!

## Acquired Skills

While working on these projects, I acquired the following skills:

- 🧠 Developed my programming logic by building programs in VB.net. Now, my code is so logical that even algorithms ask for advice.

- 🌐 Semantically structured an HTML document. My pages are now like poems; each tag is a stanza, and each element is a word that tells a story.

- 📱 Learned to make layouts responsive and mobile-first using Flexbox in CSS. Now, my designs are more flexible than a yoga session for developers.

- 🚀 Learned a significant part of the JavaScript world, even mastered some frameworks like Vue. Now, programming in JavaScript is like a dance, and I am the master of the code dance floor.

- 🌐 Learned to create my own API using NodeJs and interact with a database. Now, databases and I are like best friends, always sharing secrets (and data).

- ...and many more. After all, every line of code is a step towards the infinite universe of development!

## Learning Resources

Recommended study sources:

- 🥷 [NetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja): YouTube channel with straight

-to-the-point lessons, bringing projects and technologies in an engaging way. It's like a TV series marathon, but with code.

- 🔥 [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@fireship): Channel with humorous videos about tutorials, curiosities, and tech news. Learning here is like eating pizza: it's fun, and you always want more.

- 🐧 [Diolinux](https://www.youtube.com/@Diolinux): Largest Brazilian channel for lessons, tutorials, and news on the open-source side of technology. Some videos have titles and subtitles in English.

- 🏋️‍♂️ [Exercism](https://exercism.org/): Non-profit platform delivering fluency in over 67 programming languages through exercises. If you like it, make a donation! It's the only place where sweating while programming is highly recommended.

- 📚 [Educative](https://www.educative.io/): Interactive course platform with certifications in programming languages and technologies in general. Most courses are paid, but, as they say, knowledge has no price (but sometimes has a subscription).

I will be updating this list as I find more quality study sources.
